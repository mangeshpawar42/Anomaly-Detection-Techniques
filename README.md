# Anomaly Detection Techniques

I recently learned about several anomaly detection techniques in Python. These techniques identify anomalies (outliers) in a more mathematical way than just making a scatterplot or histogram and eyeballing it. If a point is an outlier with respect to its values across 30 features (a multivariate outlier), you canâ€™t identify it using the above methods, which is where these techniques come in.
